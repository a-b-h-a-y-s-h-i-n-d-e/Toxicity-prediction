## üåü Overview
This project is a **toxicity prediction tool** built using [DeepChem](https://deepchem.io/), an open-source toolkit for deep learning in chemistry, biology, 
and materials science. It uses the **Tox21 dataset**, a benchmark dataset for chemical compound toxicity classification, to predict the potential toxicity of chemical compounds.

## üìö What is Toxicity Prediction?

Toxicity prediction involves determining whether a chemical compound can have harmful effects on human health or the environment. It is crucial for drug discovery, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection.

The Tox21 dataset includes information on **12 different toxic effects**, such as:

- Nuclear receptor signaling pathways
- Stress response pathways

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features of the Project

- **Multitask Classification:** The model predicts toxicity across 12 classes simultaneously.
- **ROC AUC Metrics:** Evaluates model performance using the ROC AUC score.
- **DeepChem Integration:** Leverages DeepChem's functionality to simplify dataset handling, model training, and evaluation.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Dataset:** The Tox21 dataset, which includes chemical features (`X`) and toxicity labels (`y`).
2. **Model Architecture:** A fully connected neural network (Multitask Classifier) with two hidden layers.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** The ROC AUC score indicates the model's ability to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic compounds.
